# FORGE visual identity kit

Reference: IBM DESIGN.md from VoltAgent/awesome-design-md. Selected mark: the Cutword app icon. The earlier recommendation was 01 Monolith.

Files:
- DESIGN.md (repository root): FORGE-specific design rules.
- forge-cutword-app-icon.svg: vector master of the selected mark, with a 1024 px PNG alongside.
- forge-tokens.css: light and dark CSS tokens plus a small base control style.
- FORGE-IDENTITY.html: self-contained visual guide with the generated logo comparison, theme toggle and color swatches. Open locally in a browser.
- FORGE-Logo-Concepts.png: full-resolution comparison sheet with all three generated logo directions.
- logo-prompts.json: original concept prompts used with the built-in imagegen tool and a note on the final opaque comparison.
- REFERENCE-LICENSE.txt: the license of the reference collection.

The HTML embeds the final comparison image so the visual guide remains self-contained. Font binaries are not included. Install or self-host IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono to match the specification exactly; the HTML falls back gracefully to system fonts.

Logo sheets are generated raster concepts; the Cutword SVG is the editable master of the selected mark. CSS/Markdown tokens are authoritative for exact colors and measurements. The interface in the guide is a style specimen with simulated values, not an implemented banking application.

Validation: the image, named contrast pairs, HTML structure and archive integrity were checked. Desktop/mobile browser rendering was not verified because a browser executable was unavailable in the build environment.
